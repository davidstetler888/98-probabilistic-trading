### Probabilistic Labeling
```python
def create_probabilistic_labels(df, future_window=24):
    """Create probabilistic labels based on outcome distributions"""
    
    # Calculate all possible outcomes in future window
    future_returns = []
    for i in range(1, future_window + 1):
        future_returns.append(df['close'].shift(-i) / df['close'] - 1)
    
    # Create outcome distribution
    outcomes = pd.DataFrame(future_returns).T
    
    # Calculate key statistics
    labels = pd.DataFrame(index=df.index)
    labels['max_favorable'] = outcomes.max(axis=1)
    labels['max_adverse'] = outcomes.min(axis=1)
    labels['final_return'] = outcomes.iloc[:, -1]
    labels['volatility'] = outcomes.std(axis=1)
    labels['hit_target_prob'] = (outcomes >= 0.0015).mean(axis=1)
    labels['hit_stop_prob'] = (outcomes <= -0.0015).mean(axis=1)
    
    # Expected value calculation
    labels['expected_value'] = labels['hit_target_prob'] * 0.0030 - labels['hit_stop_prob'] * 0.0015
    
    return labels
```

### Multi-Task Model Architecture
```python
class TradingPredictor:
    """Multi-task model predicting multiple trading outcomes"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.direction_model = lgb.LGBMClassifier()
        self.magnitude_model = lgb.LGBMRegressor()
        self.volatility_model = lgb.LGBMRegressor()
        self.timing_model = lgb.LGBMRegressor()
        
    def predict_comprehensive(self, X):
        """Predict all aspects of trade outcome"""
        direction_prob = self.direction_model.predict_proba(X)
        expected_return = self.magnitude_model.predict(X)
        expected_volatility = self.volatility_model.predict(X)
        expected_timing = self.timing_model.predict(X)
        
        return {
            'direction_prob': direction_prob,
            'expected_return': expected_return,
            'expected_volatility': expected_volatility,
            'signal_quality': self._calculate_signal_quality(...),
            'confidence': self._calculate_confidence(...)
        }
```

### Advanced Ensemble
```python
specialists = {
    'trending_breakout': TrendBreakoutModel(),
    'mean_reversion': MeanReversionModel(), 
    'volatility_expansion': VolatilityModel(),
    'news_reaction': NewsReactionModel(),
    'session_transition': SessionModel()
}

def ensemble_prediction(X, market_regime, volatility_state):
    """Route to appropriate specialist models"""
    
    if market_regime == 'trending' and volatility_state == 'expanding':
        primary = specialists['trending_breakout']
        secondary = specialists['volatility_expansion']
        weights = [0.7, 0.3]
    # ... other combinations
    
    predictions = []
    for model, weight in zip([primary, secondary], weights):
        pred = model.predict(X)
        predictions.append(pred * weight)
