## 🎮 **How to Use**

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Run all optimizations with monitoring
python run_optimizations.py --target_trades_per_week 45 --monitor_performance
```

### **Advanced Usage**
```bash
# Custom configuration
python run_optimizations.py \
  --target_trades_per_week 50 \
  --apply_phase1 \
  --start_date 2023-01-01 \
  --end_date 2023-12-31 \
  --monitor_performance
```

### **Individual Components**
```bash
# Just run ranker with dynamic thresholding
python train_ranker.py --run $RUN_ID --target_trades_per_week 45

# Just run simulation with dynamic position sizing
python simulate.py --run $RUN_ID
```
